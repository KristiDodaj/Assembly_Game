# Assembly Game Project

Welcome to the Assembly Game Project! This is a project that I've been working on for my CSCB58 course! This project is written in 32 Bit MIPS assembly language and is a simple platformer game.

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to have an assembler and emulator installed on your computer. Once you have those installed, you can download the project files and assemble the code. After that, you can run the emulator and start playing the game!

## Demo

Check out this video demo of the game in action!
